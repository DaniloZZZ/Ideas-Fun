# Ideas-Fun
A backlog of things I think deserve being implemented. **If you like** smth and want to see results or develop yourself I beg u to **write [me](http://lykov.tech)**.  I will either increasse priority or help in writing. 

Please contact me if you know similar things implemented by others.

# Python
- [ ] Modelling of diffusion equation where inital distribution is an arbitrary photo
  - [x] 1-d case:: _progress: 3/5_
  - [x] 2-d (image) case
  - [ ] web GUI (?)
  
- [ ] Modellling of laplace equation (Wave eq) where inital state is an arbitrary song

- [x] Using Advanced Vector Extentions - a set of processor instructions for vector operations - embes asm to c++ and call c++ from python

## ML
- [ ] Train conv net on PCA representation of datasets.
- [ ] Get nice girls pics from Tinder/Vk and auto-find me a gf ðŸ˜Ž
- [ ] Train RNN on waveform or spectrum of song
- [ ] Track day activity and record self-esteem. Predict the mood. (Data: sms from banks, messages in soc.nets, browser activity, loc data.)
- [ ] Train network on 1 image pes few classes, then 10 images all classes, then 100 images, then all. The idea: to initialize properly via 1st fast iterations

## Jupyter
- [ ] Create a package for communicating between notebooks.
    *Imagine: you are training a netork and need to evaluate it in the middle of the process. Just Pickle the model, send it ofer tcp local or write to file and receive in other notebook and do things. Same stuff with data.*

## Bots
- [ ] [Tgflow](http://github.com/DaniloZZZ/tgflow)  - add _(web? electron?)_ gui for designing bots.  
- [ ] Port tgflow to Slack
- [x] Add tgflow support for VK
- [ ] Bot for GoalNet

# JavaScript
- [ ] Cerebro plugin for GoalNet
- [ ] Script to generate boilerplate code for service: express.js server, mongodb, react+coffee gui - based on .yml of Items
  - [ ] sh script generating .coffee for displaying collection Item
  - [ ] server.js code jenerating
  - [x] mongodb init from .yml
  - [ ] Dockerfile (?)
  - [ ] pack this as repo, publish, write docs
