# Ideas-Fun
A backlog of things I thing deserve being implemented. **If you like** smth and want to see results or develop yourself I beg u to **write [me](lykov.tech)**.  I will either increasse priority or help in writing. 

Please contact [me](lykov.tech) if you know similar things implemented by others.

# Python
- [ ] Modelling of diffusion equation where inital distribution is an arbitrary photo
  - [ ] 1-d case _progress: 2/5_
  - [ ] 2-d (image) case
  - [ ] web GUI (?)
  
- [ ] Modellling of laplace equation (Wave eq) where inital state is an arbitrary song

## ML
- [ ] Train conv net on PCA representation of datasets.
- [ ] Get nice girls pics from Tinder/Vk and auto-find me a gf ðŸ˜Ž
- [ ] Train RNN on waveform or spectrum of song
- [ ] Track day activity and record self-esteem. Predict the mood. (Data: sms from banks, messages in soc.nets, browser activity, loc data.)

## Jupyter
- [ ] Create a package for communicating between notebooks.
    *Imagine: you are training a netork and need to evaluate it in the middle of the process. Just Pickle the model, send it ofer tcp local or write to file and receive in other notebook and do things. Same stuff with data.*

## Bots
- [ ] [Tgflow](http://github.com/DaniloZZZ/tgflow)  - add _(web? electron?)_ gui for designing bots.  
- [ ] Bot for GoalNet

# JavaScript
- [ ] Cerebro plugin for GoalNet
- [ ] Script to generate boilerplate code for service: express.js server, mongodb, react+coffee gui - based on .yml of Items
  - [ ] sh script generating .coffee for displaying collection Item
  - [ ] server.js code jenerating
  - [ ] mongodb init from .yml
  - [ ] Dockerfile (?)
  - [ ] pack this as repo, publish, write docs
